## What is this Project?
This isn't even really a project. It's pieces of scripts and code scraps that I built as I informally introduced myself to programming, during the summer of being a rising senior in high school.  
You will see pieces of small projects that I used to work on for daily convenience in this repository.  

## My favorite scraps
"Schedule Pairer" was my first project helping my friend pair tutor-tutee schedule for a tutoring program she started during COVID. It is not the original version of code, and you should thank  God it isn't if you're reading this.  
"College Mail Sending" was a tool I used to automate email contents for my application-related questions towards universities I was applying to. I learned the hard way that I should treat sending emails more seriously after this.  
"I wanna talk too" is a piece of application I assembled with virtual microphones and Discord Settings that lets me enter voice chats with a bot voice, because I was too shy to use my own.  
"Interview Simulator" and the Northwestern Interview Question List is my mechanism for preparing my interview during college applications. No I did not get accepted by Northwestern.  
"Project Josh" was a fun mingame and my first try at object-oriented design that I showcased on my Discord server.  
And then there are some separate testing scripts for small concepts, such as threading, recursion, sorting, Monte Carlo simulations, completing my math homeworks... etc.
